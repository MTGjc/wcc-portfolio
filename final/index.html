                A livid sky where hurricanes were hatching,
                <br>Sweetness that charms, and joy that makes one die.
                <br><br>A lighting-flash — then darkness! Fleeting chance
                <br>Whose look was my rebirth — a single glance!
                <br>Through endless time shall I not meet with you?
                <br><br><p class = "faroff">Far off!</p> <p class = "faroff">too late!</p> or never! — I not knowing
                <br>Who you may be, nor you where I am going —
                <br>You, whom I might have loved, who know it too!
            </p>
